Trie Phone book

-getXml The function used for visualization, I used the TinyXml library to put the tree as XML and export it to an outer file named Phonebook.xml

-buildPhoneBook is the function responsible for taking the names and addresses from terminal

-searchPhoneBook takes names you want to retreive their addresses from the terminal 

-insert(root, name, address) inserts the name & address into the phonebook tree 

-retrieveAddress(root, name) returns the address associated with the given name from the tree
